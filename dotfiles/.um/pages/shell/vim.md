## Find & replace for accross multiple files
``:args `grep -r -l 'foo' src```
: Populate args with the files that have the thing being replaced.

`fd blah | xargs vim`
: Populate args when starting vim.

`rg -l "@Test" | xargs vim`
: Same as above

`:args`
: Verify the list looks okay, i.e. no build files or git files in there.

`:argdo %s/@Test/\/\/@Test/g | update`
: Do the replacement. Pipes run additional commands. You generally have to write at the end because
otherwise vim won't move on to the next file.

`:argdo /\/\/@Test/s//@Test public void noopForDisablingTests() {}\r\/\/@Test/ | update`
: Similar to aboveâ€”replaces just the first instance of \\@Test with a noop test.

`:argdo execute 'normal o@SetThreadLocalContext' | w`
: Do some normal mode stuff.

## Macros

`qa i//<esc> q`

`:5,10norm! @a`
